# Coding_Assignment_3_Data_Bias
This project is for I310D. For this assignment, I am testing the accuracy of the Perspective API in its ability to identify toxic comments/tweets targeted to males and females. 
The hypothesis that I tested was that Perspective API would be less likely to identify harmful female tweets as toxic than harmful male content.
From my testing, I found that my hypothesis was incorrect. I found that the API better identified harmful female content than male. The API was 62% accurate for the males, while it was 75% accurate for females. Further explanation and results can be seen in the Coding Assignment 3 notebook.
